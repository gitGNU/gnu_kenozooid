Dive Computer Support
=====================
Kenozooid allows to fetch data from dive computers produced by different
manufacturers. Also, it is possible to use some unique features of specific
dive computers like performing simulation (or in the future changing dive
computer configuration).

The supported dive computers and their drivers are listed in the table
below.
