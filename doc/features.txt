Features
========

Kenozooid is under development but following features are already present

- supported devices 
    - open source OSTC dive computer by HeinrichsWeikamp GbR,
      http://www.heinrichsweikamp.net/ostc/en/
    - dummy device driver displaying information to standard output
- device drivers can implement different capabilities, i.e. one dive
  computer can provide dive logbook data and allows to enter simulation
  mode, but other dive computer allows to fetch dive logbook only
- list available dive computers drivers and their capabilities
- scan for attached dive computers

Depending on dive computer driver capabilities

- enter dive simulation mode and send specification of dive simulation to
  a dive computer

Planned features

- fetch dive logbook data for dives made in specified period of time
- create a dive graph
