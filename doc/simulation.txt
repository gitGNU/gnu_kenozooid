Dive Simulation
===============

Ability to perform dive simulation implemented in some of dive computers
can be great tool to familiarize yourself with computer screens and
features present during diving.

Kenozooid supports switching dive computers into simulation mode using
``simulate`` command. The command can be used to perform end-to-end
simulation or part of it, i.e. start simulation but do not finish it or
jump in during dive simulation and provide dive specification for some
period of time.

Please note, this is real time dive simulation, therefore real life rules
may apply to some of dive computers

- when you reach surface, then computer may wait some time before exiting
  dive mode, if another simulation is started too fast, then it is counted
  as one dive

Please, read about dive simulation capabilities in your dive computer
manual before starting to use Kenozooid software to simulate dives.
